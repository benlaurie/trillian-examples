# A Trillian tutorial in seven diffs

This tutorial shows how to build a demo application using Trillian that creates a log, and from the log,
creates a map, and then serves that map from a webserver.

The master branch contains the completed project. The seven steps can be viewed as diffs here:

1. [Getting the data](https://github.com/benlaurie/trillian-examples/compare/register-0...benlaurie:register-1?expand=1).
2. [Add the data to a log](https://github.com/benlaurie/trillian-examples/compare/register-1...benlaurie:register-2?expand=1).
3. [Extract the log entries](https://github.com/benlaurie/trillian-examples/compare/register-2...benlaurie:register-3?expand=1).
4. [Create a map from the logged data](https://github.com/benlaurie/trillian-examples/compare/register-3...benlaurie:register-4?expand=1).
5. [Extract entries from the map](https://github.com/benlaurie/trillian-examples/compare/register-4...benlaurie:register-5?expand=1).
6. [Create map entries for the map keys so we can iterate over them](https://github.com/benlaurie/trillian-examples/compare/register-5...benlaurie:register-6?expand=1).
7. [Add a webserver](https://github.com/benlaurie/trillian-examples/compare/register-6...benlaurie:register-7?expand=1).
